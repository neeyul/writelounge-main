            <p>Strong writers vary their sentence types. Some sentences are short, others have multiple parts, and many are often longer than they need to be. The three basic types of sentences below should help you understand the choices you have in varying your sentence structures. <br><br>

<strong>Simple Sentences</strong><br><br>
A “simple sentence” simply has a noun and a verb. “The dog ran.” These are quite to the point, and could contain modifications on either the noun or the verb, but do not have complementary parts such as extra clauses or listings.<br><br>
These are best used for emphasis. “The brown dog ran quickly” is an example of a modified simple sentence.  
These are often called “independent clauses” because the idea can function independently. 
<br><br>
<strong>Complex Sentences</strong><br><br>
“Complex sentences” aren’t as complex as you might think! They are essentially one independent clause paired with some type of dependent clause – a subsequent idea that supplements the former. “The dog ran, he was very fluffy” is an example of a complex sentence.  
<br>
<br>
You can join compound sentences with complex sentences to make “compound-complex sentences.”  For example, “The dog ran and climbed a tree, he was very fluffy” is a compound-complex sentence. 
<br><br>
<strong>Compound Sentences 
</strong><br>
<br>
A “compound sentence” is two independent clauses (see “simple sentence” above) joined by a connecting word. “The dog ran and he climbed a tree.”  Such connecting words include and, for, thus, so and but. 
<br><br>
<strong>Parallel Structure
</strong><br>
<br>
Parallel structure is both easy and useful.  See what I did there?  The “both…and” construction sets up a simple parallel structure.  The overall idea is to equate one part of your sentence with another. Other common parallel constructions include “not only…but also”; “either…or”; and “neither…nor.” <br><br>

Another example of parallelism happens in simple lists, such as, “I enjoy driving the winding road to the lake, swimming in its waters, and drying on its beaches.”  Keep in mind that you want to remain consistant with your verbs (here I used gerunds, verbs ending in –ing, but the thought is the same.  If you use present verbs, stay in the present tense.  If you use past tense, stay in it).

            <p><strong>Comma Drama</strong><br><br>
I like to think about commas as sort of “breaths” that occur in the sentence if you were reading it aloud (and you should be). Whereas periods are full stops, commas are shorter pauses. While the next two examples are not all the uses of a comma, they are the most frequently confusing ones. 
<br><br>
You can use commas to separate items in a short listing.  For example, “I enjoy hiking, biking, and skiing” shows how to use commas in a list. Be sure to include the comma before “and” if you mean to separate the objects – this is called “The Oxford Comma.”  Without it, you might not convey the message you intend.  “For breakfast I ate bacon, eggs, and orange juice.” This clearly shows that you had three things for breakfast.  Howeer, “for breakfast, I ate bacon, eggs and orange juice" implies that you prefer to cook your eggs with orange juice (hey, to each their own!). 
<br><br>
You can also use commas to indicate an address – someone to whom you’re speaking.  An infamous example of this is, “Let’s eat, grandma!” This shows the comma placed before the object of the address (grandma).  Without it, the thought becomes: “Lets eat grandma!” Subtle differences in punctuation - big differences in meaning! 
<br><br>
<strong>Using Colons and Semicolons
</strong><br>
<br>
Colons and semicolons are neat pieces of punctuation that serve a purpose: listing or introducing/affixing related ideas onto the end of a sentence.  To start a list, simply introduce what you will be listing, add a colon, then begin listing. For example, the following is an example listing my favorite kinds of pizza toppings: sausage, chicken, olives, ham, garlic.  
<br><br>
Semicolons can be used in a couple different ways.  First, you can think about them as kind of an “equal sign” for joining two independent clauses that you believe should not be separated by a period, but want to join them in thought like a comma (see how a semicolon has a period AND a comma built into it? Neat, huh?).  A semicolon can take the place of coordinating words such as and, so, and thus. “The dog ran and climbed a tree; he was fluffy and slobbered a lot.”
<br><br>
You can also use semicolons to separate parts of a list.  For example, “I have lived in the following places: Henderson, Kentucky; Evansville, Indiana; and Carbondale, Illinois." <br><br>

            <p>The following are examples of things that are not necessarily “grammatically wrong” but rather “grammatically bothersome” to some.  It’s best to avoid these, but they can certainly have their place for emphasis reasons. Being aware of them will help you to determine when or when not to use these constructions.  
<br><br>
<strong>Dangling Prepositions
</strong><br>
<br>
When a sentence ends in a preposition (“anywhere a mouse can go,” remember?), it is considered “dangled.” The examples “Where are you coming from?” “Who are you talking to?” “She eventually came around” and “Do you know what that movie is about?” all show prepositions dangled at the end of sentences.  
<br><br>
To remedy this, either remove the preposition completely (in the first example – “Where are you going”), change the form of the pronouns and/or move the preposition in front of the indirect question word (the second example – “To whom are you talking?”), use a different expression (the third example – “She eventually understood.”). Sometimes it may "sound weird," but it might be a better choice in certain circumstances. Eventually, dangled ones may "sound weird!"
<br><br>
<strong>That/Which</strong><br><br>
Typically, you will see “which” in a sentence following after a comma. “I drooled over the dessert, which I bought from the store.” This shows the use of which with a comma introducing the idea.  For "that," it expresses the same idea but without the pause in the sentence: “I drooled over the dessert that I bought from the store.”  
<br><br>
<strong>Split Infinitives
</strong><br>
<br>
The classic example of a “split infinitive” (when something comes between the to and the verb) is from the Star Trek Captain’s Oath: “to boldly go.” See how “to go” is “split” by the adverb boldly? 
<br><br>
Sometimes this is not completely unacceptable, particularly if you want to emphasize by position. For example, “I am going to completely and savagely devour my dessert.” The "fix" for this would simply be to move the adverbs completely and savagely after the object: “I am going to devour my dessert completely and savagely.” Sometimes you can move your modifying words after the infinitive verb construction (“to [verb]”), or after another part of the sentence. Try a few variations, and choose your favorite!<br><br>

            <p>When you’ve found a really great citation, talk with it! Try to expand its meaning, challenge it, or clarify it.  It is not best practice to simply leave the citation “floating” in the text, unattended by any type of relevant discourse and unattached in the paragraph.  Each citation should be surrounded by relevant ideas that could lead into the citation, depart from it, or interact with it. 
<br><br>
In that sense, try not to leave a citation simply “dangling” at the end of a paragraph either.  There are transitions that need to be made, even if the citation itself works itself nicely into the next paragraph.  <strong>Try to say something about anything you cite.</strong>  The more you’re able to talk with your citations rather than talk by them, the stronger your writing will be!

            <p>Synthesis, bringing together ideas from different sources, is a critical component of academic writing.  The way I think about synthesis is if the sources were talking to each other, having a conversation, what would they say? Are there any unique perspectives that one source could bring to bear in another’s context? What relationships exist between the sources?
<br><br>
First, I like to write out the main ideas of what the source is trying to say, maybe even copy down its thesis/theses statement(s).  Once you have that information, try to look between the different sources and see if there are any commonalities you could discuss. Once you find a “common thread,” notice how each author or source is approaching it in their own unique way.  
 <br><br>
See what’s at stake in the sources, what the material being discussed actually means in a context outside of the source or study itself. Does this source mean anything if you were a different reader other than yourself, in your own familiar culture? Decentering yourself to experience the text in a plurality of ways is a great strategy to see the possibilities of meaning outside of the immediate experience of the text itself, as well reflect upon your own experiences woth the text.

            <p>In Ken Macrorie’s piece <em>Uptaught</em> (Boynton/Cook 1996), he discusses a tendency for those writers entering university writing programs to think they have to write really lofty, high-spoken, and ridged prose that is drawn out.  He calls this type of language, which often does not have much meaning on its own, "Engfish." In doing this, the author sounds unnatural – like they’re trying too hard to sound “right.” After all, college writing is all about sounding “academic,” right? Well, yes and no.<br><br>
While the academy expects certain conventions of discourse from its members, every piece of writing should have room to breathe, so as to let the author’s unique voice and expression shine instead of being shadowed by attempts to “sound academic.” <strong>Here are a few voicing tips as you write and revise:</strong> 
<br>
<br>
1.	Try to eliminate “useless” words or phrases, those that don’t really serve a purpose.  Consider the following opening: “In today’s modern day and age in contemporary western society of America…”  There’s a great deal of “empty” words that seem to only serve the purpose of “sounding academic.” <br><br>
2.	Vary <a href="#page43">sentence structures</a>.  Don’t always feel you need to have complex or complicated sentences.  Sometimes short and sweet does the trick! <br><br>
3. Read the writing aloud - this is <strong>crucial.</strong>  If it sounds awkward, it probably is. <br><br>
4. Chill.  Just relax! :) Writing is not something about which to stress and confine your own way of expression into a little, academic box. Writing is a conversation, and it should sound natural. However, you want to consider your audience and the types of language conventions they value.

            <p>Consider your work as one large puzzle: there should be several smaller pieces, each with their unique images, fit, and contribution to the larger picture.  Each piece has a definite place and function within smaller “groups” of the puzzle too.  Let’s think about a piece of writing this way.  Ask yourself two questions in each paragraph (or each sentence…or even each word!).<br><br>
1.	What is this piece trying to do? What part of the puzzle does it fill? <br><br>
2.	To what can this piece connect? Are there any manageable “groups” among which that you could situate this piece? Does it share the same theme or sentiment as another piece or group?<br><br>
When you begin to see how the pieces fit together in your writing, you will surely be able to connect them better and flesh out clearer images of the larger meanings in your text. Sentences become paragraphs, become pages, become sections, become chapters.  Everything should fit together nicely.<br><br>
If you're having difficulty "seeing the pieces," just write briefly beside the paragraph: what's the main idea? What am I trying to say here? Make the connections from there.

            <p>Sometimes it’s a good idea to simply rewrite parts of your work in order to revisit them.  Perhaps there’s a better way of saying what you’ve already said, you just need to try on different ways of saying it! Rewriting parts of your work – topical sentences, things that surround citations, transitions, and intros/conclusions might help you discover ideas that you may have missed the first go-round. 
<br><br>
Try to write two different “thesis” (or simply, “controlling idea(s)”) statements.  Does any one represent your ideas about the work clearer? Is there another way you could summarize or conclude the work? There might not be just one ending! Whereas no draft is truly "final," you should try on different ways of expressing important ideas.  Like shopping for that perfect outfit, you've got to try different combinations of words to make it fit just right!

            <p>Try to “interrogate” your text.  Really put the screws to it! Ask it a series of critical questions that seek to flesh out meaning, build relevant and logical structures, and help you figure out what to write where. A “heuristic” is just a fancy word for “listing of questions,” so this approach to revision naturally centers on forming a series of direct questions to ask your text. 
<br><br>
You may choose to start with the simple “Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?” model.  A focus on the “why” and “how” will help richen your content.  You can ask questions at the micro level – “what does this sentence mean? How does it work? What is it doing?” You could ask those same questions at the paragraph, page, chapter, or whole-work level as well!  <br>
<br>
<strong>Below are some sample questions you could ask your text:</strong> 
<br><br>
“What is the author’s main idea?” <br><br>
“Why does the author believe this idea?”<br><br>
“What are the logical structures of this piece? How is the information presented?”<br><br>
“Is the presentation of information ‘effective’ to me as a reader? Why or why not?” <br><br>
“Could the ideas within the text be applied in a different context?” <br>
<br>
“Is there a different framework that could apply to the text?” <br><br>
“Where could this article potentially ‘pick up’ for future research?” <br><br>
“Are there any ‘gaps’ in the information?” <br><br>
"Why would someone choose to read this?"<br><br>
"What is this text 'doing' for this subject's conversation?"<br><br>
"If I were a different type of reader (different culture, etc.), how could I interpret this text?"

            <p>Let’s get something straight: planning does not just happen at the beginning. There is no “brainstorm” stage before moving onto anything else.  Planning happens <em>all the time</em>, between the blinks of your cursor, between footsteps down the street. As you write, you simultaneously plan.  But, there is merit for consolidating much of this planning time before you sit down to write that first word. <br><br>
            <strong>Idea Mapping</strong><br><br>
Consider your writing as an endless web of ideas, sprawling out from a central core – your thesis (main or controlling idea). A great way to “map” your ideas is to visually represent this web: write out the main thought or point you’re trying to make with your writing and circle it.  Draw lines coming off that circle that lead to related ideas.  The main idea here is to work from the general to the specific.
<br><br>
For example, if my controlling idea was “comparing types of pizza,” I would draw lines from that center to a few different points: crust type, toppings type, cooking techniques, oven types, and perhaps even ‘related pizza-like dishes.’ Within each of these new areas, you could draw even more lines leading from them into more specific ideas.  For “toppings type,” I might subordinate it into “vegetables” and “meats,” which could even further be subordinated. 
<br><br>
<strong>Basic Outlining
</strong><br>
<br>
If you are not so inclined to visually represent your ideas in a webbed network like that mentioned above, you could try to construct a basic outline.  The trick here is to establish a “hierarchy,” a logical ordering of your ideas.  This is also a great note-taking strategy!  Follow the example below: 
<br><br>
I. Main idea 1<br>
	a. related idea 1 <br>
b. related idea 2<br>
	i. subtopic 1 <br>
	ii. subtopic 2 <br>
	iii. subtopic 3 <br>
c. related idea 3:<br><br>
II. Main idea 2<br>
a.	related idea 1<br>
you get the idea….<br>
<br>
The breakdown of this outline is simple: use capital Roman numerals for your main ideas; lowercase letters subordinate your main idea into related thoughts; within those related ideas, break them down with lowercase Roman numerals.  Try to get a full sentence out of your main idea, and make each related idea and subtopic sections as long as you need it to be. 
<br><br>
Either of these simple outline strategies will help you organize your writing in powerful ways.  If you've got a great way to organize your thoughts, please discuss it using the button below!

            <p>Ethos – or “credibility” is an important thing to consider when evaluating a text: who was the author? Why are they credible to write this piece? What contributing factors might influence the perception of the author? 
<br><br>
<strong>A biographical approach</strong><br>
Send the author’s name through a Google search and see what comes up. Maybe they have a Wikipedia (gasp!) or personal homepage that provides you with a basic sense of who they are, what their specialty is, and in what contexts (historical, political, geographical, etc.) they worked. 
<br><br>
It’s always a good idea to make the authors seem like real people, that way it might be easier to consider yourself in a conversation with them, rather than simply borrowing someone else’s voice to make your point.  Perhaps there are certain elements of the author's life that influenced the way they wrote, and these are often great things to discuss in evaluating an author's ethos.

            <p>Now that you’ve found your author, what else did they write and perhaps importantly – who else did they cite?  <br>
<br>
First, you may want spend a moment to briefly look at their other works.  See what kinds of ideas are represented in them, perhaps there are patterns of content or methods present in multiple sources of the author.  Either way, it behooves you to take a look at the other things the author wrote in order to fully <a href="#page55">examine their ethos</a>. <br><br>
It’s also tremendously helpful to take a few minutes to jot down a few of the author’s main ideas to see if there are commonalities between your own research and theirs.  Perhaps you both read the same work, and that might lead you down a fruitful research path!

            <p>You can apply the same “interrogation” strategies in revision that you can when researching or writing the text.  It might be helpful to consider the purpose for a piece of academic writing not so much to answer something, but rather question it.  
<br><br>
A quick activity that can help exercise this idea is to ask a question about each paragraph, and write it in the margin. What is this paragraph specifically trying to do? Play Jeopardy with your text: find the questions with which your answers (content) aligns.  Each idea is an answer to some question, and seeking these questions is a great place to begin to expand your writing in meaningful ways. <br><br>
The main point about finding questions and not necessarily answers is to determine what directions your own writing and thinking are able to move, and where you can make these moves in the text.

            <p>How can one work with several different authors writing about related ideas? Sometimes, you might find they’re citing the same works! Still, there are a few things you can do to help distinguish and work with multiple voices: <br><br>
1.	Find out something unique about their work: a method, a result, a conclusion, anything.  Make this unique attribute the center of your discussion towards their work. <br><br>
2.	Condense their work into one or two sentences.  Compare the sentences that you’ve found among the various authors, and see what the differences and similarities are.  From this, you will be able to talk about each in relevant detail once you go back into the text and uncover specifics about what you've condensed. <br><br>
3.	Mind the gaps! Write down what the particular author might be missing in his or her work.  Perhaps there are some areas that could use more explanation that another author might have addressed.

            <p>Below you will find a few quick rhetorical methods, designed to critically interpret any piece of communication: a text, image, video, etc. Try mixing them to fit your appropriate context! 
<br><br>
<strong>Triangulating Audience-Text-Action
</strong><br>
<br>
In each piece of writing there are three central components: the <strong>audience</strong>; the <strong>content</strong> of the text itself (its research, methods, findings, discussions, etc.); and an <strong>“action”</strong> – what the author sees the audience “doing” with the text.  Finding each of these three items, and discovering how they work with each other, will help you better interpret a text. 
<br><br>
First, the audience: to whom is the author writing? Is the recipient of the text supposed to be someone involved in their specialty/field, or are they talking to the general public? Why would the author decide to write to this audience and not another? What choices do they make in how they address their audience? 
<br><br>
The body of the text itself can be broken up several different ways.  For the purpose of brevity here, we will separate it into three parts: the thesis, the method, and the discussion. The <strong>thesis</strong> (plural, theses) is a central, controlling idea that each paragraph of the text should somehow address.  Finding what this is will help you zero in on what the work is discussing.  

The <strong>method</strong> is simply “how” the author is discussing their thesis.  Are they doing a particular kind of study? If so, “how” are they going about it? Finally, the discussion is everything outside of the thesis and method.  This is all the supporting information that works for the thesis, through its method.  
<br><br>
Finally, the <strong>action</strong> of a text is anything the author is persuading the audience to do or believe. Is the author arguing for a particular side? If so, he or she is advocating the audience to believe certain things about the topic.  And as there is persuasion to thought, there is also persuasion to action. Perhaps the author is advocating that people get involved in local volunteer opportunities, or in much of academic writing, the author is advocating that the subject be researched further in specific ways.  
<br><br>
<strong>Historical-Contextual Framework 
</strong><br>
<br>
This method asks the critic to think about the text in terms of when it was written, and in what contexts it was written. What were some events going on in the world (or in particular, the places in which the text was written) that might have influenced the text or author?  What were the dominant beliefs about the subject matter at the time, and about culture in general? What value systems were in place at that time, in those places? Trying to situate yourself in the time and places in which the text was written can sometimes be helpful to understanding both the author and the work. 
<br><br>
<strong>Pentad/Hexad Analysis
</strong><br>
<br>
This is my favorite mode of rhetorical criticism, simply because it is simple, and covers nearly everything you would want to know about, well, anything!  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatism" target="_system">Dramatism</a> is a method that was established by Kenneth Burke (a venerable rockstar for us rhetoricians!), and essentially builds upon the “who, what, where, when, why” framework.  Depending on who and when you ask, there are either five or six parts of this analysis (the “pentad” and “hexad,” respectively): <br><br>
1.	Act: (What?) What is happening? What is being discussed? <br><br>
2.	Scene: (Where/When?) Where is the Act happening? When is it being discussed? <br><br>
3.	Purpose: (Why?) Why is the Act happening? Why are the Agents acting the way they are? For what reasons are things the way they are? <br><br>
4.	Agent: (Who?) Who is involved in the Act? What parties are represented in the Act? <br><br>
5.	Agency: (How?) How are the Agents acting within the Act? What powers or influences do they have? <br><br>
6.	Attitude: (Mix of How/Why) What are the attitudes the Agents might have towards any element listed above? What are the attitudes of the audience? The author?

            <p>The following frameworks will help you dive into the work in a few specialized ways.  There is a small list of questions under each heading that will help you get started in critically evaluating the text. 
<br><br>
<strong>Gender Framework
</strong><br>
<br>
How is gender being represented in the text? 
Are there any biases towards a specific gender represented in the text? <br><br>
Is the audience for whom the text is written multi-gendered, or leaning towards one? <br><br>
Does the author’s gender somehow influence the discussion of the subject matter? <br><br>
Is the content/subject matter itself somehow viewed as “masculine” or “feminine” in our culture? In another culture? 
<br><br>
<strong>Economical Framework
</strong><br>
<br>
Are there financial concerns involved in the content/subject matter? <br><br>
Could potential financial concerns hinder the discussion? <br><br>
How could the content be expanded if money were not a concern? <br><br>
Does the subject matter or content disenfranchise or bolster any economic group? <br><br>
Does the content “mean” the same thing for members of different economic groups? <br><br>

<strong>Classist Framework</strong><br><br>
What social or political classes are represented in the text? <br><br>
Does the text privilege one social or political class over another? <br><br>
How is class deconstructed or constructed in the text? <br><br>
Can members of different social or political classes “get” the same message from the text? 
<br><br>
<strong>Cultural Framework 
</strong><br>
<br>
How is our culture represented in the text? How about another culture? 
<br>
<br>
What values are represented in the text? Are they challenged or reinforced? 
<br>
<br>
Could members of different cultures “get” the same message from the text? 
<br>
<br>
Does the author’s culture help or hinder the text? (Perhaps they’re from another culture writing about cultural ideas not present in their own)
<br>
<br>
What other cultural values across the world challenge the notions present in the text?

            <p>Your method might be one that wholly develops from the contexts of your research: the subject matter, your primary questions, your thesis/theses, your examination of author ethos, and even your speculations about the content. 
<br><br>
To custom-build a method, you might first try to mix a few <a href="#page59">general</a> and <a href="#page60">specific</a> rhetorical criticism frameworks. Although your work is not bound by any one of these, you should try to craft a methodology that works to advance your thesis/theses.  <br>
<br>
First, find out what types of ideas you will need to discuss. Then ask yourself “how could I best go about exploring these ideas” and “what kinds of questions could be asked for the types of answers I anticipate to find?” Try to group your questions together into different themes.  Be careful, however, not to overwhelm your reader with a wide range of criticism methods: choose one or two strong methods, and adhere to those.

            <p>Decentering simply means adopting a reader persona other than your current self. Find out who the work is asking the audience to be, the values that group might have, and be that person with those values, regardless of who you – the actual reader – are. 
<br><br>
<strong>Intended vs. Actual Audience
</strong><br>
<br>
The “intended” audience is the group of people for whom the author intends to write, whereas the “actual” audience is the group of people who actually read the work – and for the purposes of decentering - could read the work.  <br>
<br>
To decenter yourself as a reader, you first need to discover the intended audience of the work. Then, imagine all the other types of audiences who might actually read the work.  What values or beliefs might any one of those audiences have that influence their reading? <br>
<br>
If you, the real reader, can temporarily adopt some of these values for the purpose of reading the work, you can begin to see how the text can affect those outside of its immediate intended audience. This process is very similar to <a href="#page60">cultural criticism</a>, because it asks you to consider the text in ways outside of your own familiar frames of culture and belief.

As you move through the writing, be aware to vary your <a href="#page43">sentence structure</a> as well as consider your <a href="#page71">tone</a> and <a href="#page70">transitions</a>. Sometimes it helps to be cheeky or humorous to diffuse a chunk of “serious” text, or when you’re deep into a particular discussion or example. You want to consider how you enter and depart your ideas: provide a solid lead-in to whatever you’re discussing, and deliver an engaging way to move away from that idea.

            <p>Readers need guidance.  It’s helpful to be able to forecast to your reader what you’re going to discuss (content), and how you’re going to discuss it (methods).  Therefore, why not speak a little bit in your introduction about the general ideas of your piece, and the ways in which you’re going to present them.  
<br><br>
A great way to foreshadow is to <strong>justify.</strong> Talk about the reasons why you’re writing the piece, why you’re researching what you are, and why you’re doing things the way you are. Perhaps there are some research gaps you’re trying to fill, a position you’re trying to make sure has a voice, or a particular subject that you feel deserves more attention.  Make this clear to your reader! <br>
<br>
Justifying your content and method is a great way to inform the reader why they should care about the work, and what they should expect to find once they’re involved with reading it.<br><br>
<strong>Other ways to foreshadow</strong><br><br>
Directly: simply flat-out tell your reader what you're going to be discussing. <br><br>
Indirectly: create a "boundary" or "perimeter" of discussion - talk about the general sorts of things you will be discussing, and then narrow the reader's direction by providing more specific areas. <br><br>
Set up a structure: You may choose to end your introductory paragraph(s) by providing the larger topics you're going to be discussing, and then follow each subsequent paragraphs in transitioning through those topics.

            <p>Conclusions are kind of like the dessert of a piece of writing.  They are the sweet afterthoughts that the readers take away from the meal of text they have just consumed.

A solid conclusion serves several important purposes:

            <p>Almost as important as from where your work has come and where it is now, is where it might be going! You may recognize a gap in the research that might be filled by a more in-depth look into a specific idea, or you may see the topic as working in a different direction. In any rate, by your concluding paragraph(s), you should be able to <strong>identify places in which further writing could happen on your topic. </strong>
<br><br>
To speculate about where the topic could go is to recognize that there is still a vibrant <a href="#page102">conversation</a> still happening with the material.  Showing where the work might apply in different contexts is to strengthen your own work in its settings. Consider the following questions when speculating about future directions of your work: <br><br>
	1. If I were to write 1/10/20/100 more pages about this, what could I say? <br><br>
2. What other <a href="#page60">frameworks</a> might be appropriate for this topic? <br><br>
3. Are there any other authors or bodies of research that might better expand this topic? <br><br>
4. Is there anything that deserves clarification with further research? <br><br>
5. Are there any unanswered questions that could be explored?

            <p>It’s neat to think about what could be lurking between the period of a sentence and the next capital letter.

You can ask some <a href="#page53">critical questions</a> to point you in the directions of potential content.  <em>Potential</em> is the key word here.  When you’re writing or revising your paragraphs, try not to focus on what is there, but rather <em>what could be there. </em><br><br>
<strong>Questions to ask "in between."</strong><br><br>
*Is there anything that could connect these two ideas? <br><br>
*Could I challenge one or the other idea? Or both? <br><br>
*Are there any spaces for clarification in either idea? <br><br>
*Could I be more specific? <br><br>

            <p>One of the main misconceptions of “academic writing” is that it seeks to answer some question, defend a position, or prove a point.  While these things are all fine, and certainly have their appropriate place, quite often <a href="#page53">asking questions</a> is just as important. <br><br>
Think about what questions your writing is answering.  Maybe jot them down in the margins.  Once you have some questions, start trying to ask some related questions.

            <p>I’m sure we’ve all heard about this mysterious thing called “flow” in a piece of writing.  Like fashion sense, readers can tell if a piece of writing either has or does not have it.  However, to make sure that you’re “flowing” well does not have to be mysterious, it just means that you’re consciously aware of your rhythm and voice in the writing. 
<br><br>
First, don’t try to sound like anyone but yourself.  You don’t always have to sound like a high-brow academic. Although when writing academic pieces, you do want to maintain a sense of <a href="#page50">“Academic English,”</a> you should sound natural to your readers.  <br>
<br>
Read your work aloud, preferably to others.  If it doesn’t sound like you, and doesn’t sound natural, revise it until it does.  Perhaps even have others read your work to you so you can hear your words in another voice. <br><br>
Pay attention to the rhythm of your sentences and phrases.  Like any good piece of music, the rhythms should vary at times.  <a href="#page43">Varying your sentence structure</a> is a great way to introduce different rhythmical elements into your writing.  This makes it not seem so stale, so predictable, and so boring to read. <br>
<br>
To create effective "flow," you should be keenly aware of <a href="#page70">transitions</a> into and from your main ideas within paragraphs. There should be a natural progression that sets up an idea, and also a natural movement away from the idea and into another. <strong>Setting up effective transitions is one of the strongest things you can do to help find a good "flow." </strong>

            <p>Ideas should connect fluidly in your writing. Whether it’s between sentences, paragraphs, pages, or chapters, solid transitions will help guide your reader from the previous material into the new.  
<br><br>
Some strategies you can adopt to help transitions include:<br>
<br>
 
1.	Ask critical questions about your content and see what <a href="#page67">“fits” between</a> your previous and new content. Perhaps there is an idea that could connect them, challenge or clarify one or the other, or expand either. <br>
<br>
2.	Summarize either content in a fresh way that ties the two together. 
<br>
<br>
3.	Restate the paragraph/page/section/chapter main idea in different language that suits the next idea or the previous one. 
<br>
<br>
4.	Provide an example of or problem with the main idea that leads into the next concept you’re discussing.

            <p>“Ethos” is a Greek word that essentially means “credibility.”  As a professional or academic writer, you want to maintain a strong ethos – your tone and voice should come across as knowledgeable, assertive, helpful, and aware of your audience and material. 
<br><br>
Building a strong ethos means taking charge of your writing and being assertive about your claims.  While asking questions certainly is a good thing in writing, you want to provide claims equally as you do questions, and more importantly, substantiate your claims with strong evidence.  You want to diffuse the sense that you know what you’re talking about because you took the time to justify your claims with adequate research. No one wants to read someone who is unsure about their own ideas! 
<br><br>
To help craft assertiveness, try to provide a few different claims that begin to answer your questions.  Select the best one or two, and elaborate on them. Reserve the other claims for your <a href="#page65">conclusion</a> where you can <a href="#page66">speculate</a> about the potential directions in which your work could move in the future.

            <p>Developing a sense of empathy for your audience is very helpful to creating a usable and well-received piece of professional communication.  This awareness will help you connect to your audience’s needs, their abilities, and their connection to your own position. 
<br><br>
First, you must understand their needs: <strong>what do they value and why? What sort of things do they need to perform their job or a request? </strong>Make sure that you hone in on this, and thank them for simply taking the time to receive the message. 
<br><br>
Your audience has special abilities or positions that enable them to perform actions for you and others.  <strong>What are their abilities or positions, and how can you connect with them?  </strong>Developing a dynamic, two-way relationship with your audience is crucial in professional communication, especially when you want to get something done. 
<br><br>
Finally, <strong>how is your audience connected to your own position or abilities?  Do they rely on you for anything? Is there anything that you can offer them from your own abilities or position?</strong>
<br><br>
When you develop a sense of empathy for your audience, your communication will reflect a mindfulness towards others, and will be more warmly received by your audience.

            <p>Sometimes your intended message might not be entirely fitting for your audience.  For example, if you wanted to inform others about a new shipping policy, you would likely not send the same message to managers, warehouse staff, secretaries, members of other departments, and even fellow employees within your own department. 
<br><br>
To adapt a singular message for multiple audiences or stakeholders requires a bit of <a href="#page72">empathy</a> towards the audience’s needs, position, and abilities.  Find out <strong>what stake they have in the communication: </strong>are they people who are directly affected by it? If so, how can you help them?  Tailor your communication to fit their needs, their position, and their abilities. <br><br>
In the shipping example above, for a message send to warehouse staff, you may want to explain a bit more about why they should care about the new shipping policy and how it could help increase their own productivity. The same message for secretaries would likely include reasons as to why the policy is more efficient for the company, and would describe how to field questions about it from customers and employees.

<strong>Process Matters</strong><br>
<br>
*What are your goals for writing this particular piece (beyond getting a positive reader response, of course!)? <br>
<br>
*Are there any particular challenges that you foresee, and how might you overcome them? <br>

*How could you go about revising the piece? (Yes, think about revision before you even start drafting!) 
<br><br>
<strong>Product Matters</strong><br>
<br>
*What are some major or thematic ideas that you could talk about? <br>
<br>
*What would you like to explore? Solve? Answer? Question?  <br>
<br>
*What related ideas could you talk about? Do you have any of your own experiences that could add to or relate to the ideas you might discuss? <br>
<br>
*Do you recall any writers or credible sources in which you could anchor a particular discussion?

            <p>Being an “active” writer means being just as much a reflector as a producer: you want to spend as much time thinking about your content as much as (if not more) than producing unique content itself. It will make you a more aware communicator, a more critical thinker, and a stronger writer.  
<br><br>
To do this, try keeping an “active” writing journal: spend a few moments writing about not only what you wrote, but also how you wrote about it.  You might choose to draw a line down the middle of a page, and divide it up into “process” and “product” sections.  These reflections are valuable, and as mentioned before, might actually be able to work directly in the text itself! <br><br>
This process very closely models the type of internal discourse that you will bring about on the page through your writing, and is a wonderful way to supplement a piece of work! <br>
<br>
Reflecting as you write also serves the purpose of working out ideas at a different pace and time, and you may come to find a solution to an issue you had in your writing during reflection!

            <p>It's difficult to have a writing product without a writing process. A writing process wouldn’t be less visible unless manifested some writing product. It behooves you as a good writer to consider the way you compose and the way you revise a text.  You can ask yourself a few critical questions to reflect inwardly about your writing and its processes: 
<br><br>
1. Why are you researching your topic (other than for an assignment or potential publication)? <br><br>
2. What interests you about the topic? <br><br>
3. Why would you go about working on it the way you intend to? Are there any other ways you could begin your work? <br><br>
4. What do you hope to gain by revising the work (other than a “cleaner” draft)? Are there additional ideas that you would like to explore? Why?

            <p>There is no singular way to format a resume.  However you slice it, the document should be both <strong>readable</strong> – getting the information quickly and easily, and <strong>usable</strong> – working towards its goal in the most efficient means possible.  A resume should be concise, which means one to two pages. Many common elements include: <br><br>
1.	A Header – name and contact information.  Address, phone number, and e-mail are usually the preferred choices. Try bolding it and increasing the font size by one degree to make it stand out. <br><br>
2.	An “Objective” section – this is where you can quickly tell what <em>you can do for the company</em> and show how the position fits and advances your specialized skill set. This particular bit of information should be action-oriented and goal-centered.<br><br>
3.	Education and Experience sections – place first whichever is more pertinent for the position. Be concise, you don’t have to include everything here.  You can elaborate in more detail in the cover letter.<br><br>
4.	Awards and Achievements/Skills/Certification section – if you have enough recognitions outside of your Education or Experiences section, place them in their own section.  You may also choose to have a “Publications and Presentations” or a "Skills" section if appropriate. Any certifications or specialized training could go here. <br><br>
5.	Reference Page – simply attach a separate reference page to the resume.

            <p>Think about a resume and a cover letter as essentially one rhetorical document serving one goal: to land a position.  Everything you mention in these documents should resonate with that goal, meaning you need to consider the job and its needs as an audience of sorts.  Write to them!  
<br><br>
Your presentation of self should reflect a clear <a href="#page82">connection</a> between your experiences and the job’s requirements.  Another goal of these documents is to clearly portray you as an indispensible asset to the company.  Your goal, earning a position, should be at the center of everything you write in your resume and cover letter.  This means you need to intimately understand the job’s requirements, and who the company wants the person they hire for that position to be.  Write towards these aspects and portray yourself as that exact person. After all, why apply for a position if you feel you weren’t the person for it?

            <p>Pick the most important things to talk about in your resume, and talk about them quickly. You can elaborate in more detail in the cover letter. For example, in your “Education” section, you don’t need to put all of your student organization involvements, your entire class list, and so on.  Be concise: a major/minor, GPA, and perhaps even a few pertinent classes to the position is all you need.  And remember, <strong>stay relevant to the position and its requirements! </strong>
<br><br>
Remember, hiring personnel aren’t going to spent a long time reading your resume – they will scan it for important information and key words.  But, they will still likely read it from top to bottom, left to right.  You can capitalize on this! <br>
<br>
To deliver the most information quickly to this audience requires that you make your relevant experiences stand out.  If your educational background outweighs your professional experience, for example, consider putting your educational section first.  And within that section, you want to work from your most important information back.  Similarly, if your experience outweighs your educational background, you want to put that section first, and within it list the most suitable information first.

            <p>One of the best things you can do when preparing a resume and cover letter is to find out what the job requires, and tailor your own experiences and skills to fit those requirements.  Does it require organizational skills? Well, surely you can pull out something from your education or work experience that speaks to that need! 
<br><br>
This is not to say that you should lie about your experiences or abilities, but rather that you should pick out parts of the experiences and abilities that you actually have and showcase them as matching the position. It is important that your own resume and cover letter resonates with whatever the position requires: its responsibilities and its requirements. <br><br>
You may need to dig deep in your personal experiences to find the skills and traits that the job requires; think back to your previous jobs, your past training, coursework, projects, or personal interests.  You want to show that you already possess the requirements, and be able to clearly demonstrate them on the page.

            <p>A picture truly is worth a thousand words! Graphics in technical and professional writing should enhance the text, providing a meaningful supplement to the ideas that the author intends to diffuse to the audience. You should chose graphics that <strong>mean something to the content</strong> that you’re developing, and that <strong>characterize the service, product, or company</strong> the work is representing. 
<br><br>
Usable graphics should fit the concepts that your text is discussing: it makes no sense to have an image of an executive meeting in a brochure for a water park! They should enhance the audience’s experience of the text in ways that makes them engage with the product or company. <br>
<br>
Also, like <a href="#page43">varying your sentence structure</a>, you want to vary your graphics: don’t have every single one of your graphics look thematically the same.  No one wants to see ten pictures of suited people shaking hands. Be mindful of where you place the graphics in the work, try to vary their position and size.

            <p>When choosing graphics, consider selecting those that show action – something happening.  Readers do not want to simply be <strong>told</strong> what is happening through an image, they want to have it <strong>shown</strong> – they want to see something actually happen!  Keep in mind too that the actions that you show should <strong>accurately characterize the product, service, or company</strong> for which you are representing.  
<br><br>
Even if it is a picture of a single individual or an object, you can still have “action” happening within it if there is another part of the image that shows what the object or person <em>could do</em>.  For example, if you see a smiling face wearing a headset microphone, you might understand that to mean the person will provide some kind of phone support.  They are still <em>doing something</em> even if they are not actually providing the phone support in the image.  <br><br>
People are moved to action when they see action.  Of course, one might say that <em>all</em> images carry some kind of action as potential.  Still, you want to select images that resonate with the material you're presenting, and within those images, some resonant action should happen.

            <p>As with any piece of writing, you want to cultivate a type of “flow.”  That means an audience should be able to usably follow your text and images in a logical order.  Follow these helpful guidelines to create a path for your readership: 
<br><br>
1.	Do not “stack” images together, or place them side-by-side. Try to <a href="#page86">create a balance</a> beteween text and graphics.<br>
<br>
 
2.	Consider supplementing non-stock (those images that aren’t found in a database) images with captions.  
<br>
<br>
3.	Choose your font wisely  - remain consistent with stylistic choices.  Choose a usable typeface that is easy to read in both <strong>bold </strong>and <em>italics</em>.
<br>
<br>
4.	Separate parts of your text whenever possible by using bold and italics.  When reading a document such as a brochure, a reader will want to get to the information quickly, and choosing to parse the textual pieces with font changes helps this. It is kind of similar to separating sections of a larger research essay by use of headings.

            <p>Ever read a brochure that is all graphics and hardly any text? Not very informative.  How about one that is all text and hardly any graphics? Ugh. <br>
<br>
Strike a balance between graphics and text that does not overwhelm the reader with large blocks of texts, or a series of images.  If you must have a series of images, consider adding captions to have the readers interact with the image a bit more rather than gloss over it.  <br>
<br>
You want to create a reading experience that is fluid and dynamic, with many different ways to absorb the information: graphics, texts, and charts.  The more ways a reader can experience the material you're presenting (textually, visually, audibly, etc.), the more it is going to sink in, and the more engaged your audience will be. And, I don't know about you, but speaking to an engaged audience is far easier than one who is blankly staring at a presentation.

Readers are more likely to read a memo (or open an e-mail) with a subject line that describe some kind of action.  <strong>What do you want your readers to do</strong>: read, forward, participate, vote, respond?  By telling your readers what they can do from the get-go (in the subject line), you will create a more engaging reading experience.  
<br><br>
Action-oriented language will also increase the likelihood that your communication’s objectives will be met. Once inside the memo, you want to continue writing “action.”  Even if you are simply informing someone about something, tell them how you are informing them and what you or they could do in the future related to the content of the communication. <br>
<br>
Perhaps you can “answer questions” or they can “reply” to your message.  In any sense, stay away from just passively telling someone something, <strong>it is always better to show than tell,</strong> and the way you can do this is to imply some kind of action. You want "to verb" all the things!

            <p>When writing a letter – typically a bit longer than a memo, you can think about it as an extended memo.  Just like a short story is a smaller version of a novel, the letter can be thought of as a longer form of a memo.  While you still want to remain concise and clear in a letter, you have a little more room to expand the content by <a href="#page53">asking some critical questions</a> of the text. Ask what the reader could want to know when expanding your message for a letter, what other information would be helpful to them? <br><br>
Letters are also typically more formal than memos.  Your readership for a letter may be several levels “above” your own position, department, or even outside of your organization. Memos are usually not written for those outside of your organization.  Therefore, you want to still remain in a professional tone and consider your audience and their needs, while representing your position, department, or organization effectively and professionally. <br><br>
The format for letters largely depends on the conventions of your organization, its letterhead, and its communication protocols. Most will have a greeting, a main point (like a thesis), an explaination of that point, and a resolution - something the readership can do to move forward in addressing the point.

            <p>Ah, the e-mail.  Most e-mails that you will send and receive will be shorter in length, and resemble a memo rather than a letter.  The level of formality is typically lower than that of an official, physical communiqué, but you still want to <a href="#page72">remain aware of your audience</a> throughout writing an e-mail. <br><br>
Consider your salutation first. A simple greeting with the person’s appropriate prefix (Mr./Ms./Dr./etc.) is usually acceptable. For more informal e-mails, attach a comma, line break, and begin your body paragraph.  For more formal e-mails, use a colon instead (just like memos/letters).  Next, provide a quick, one-sentence summary of the main message of your e-mail right from the beginning.  If you need to elaborate on it, or require additional information about it, be very concise about it.
<br><br>
<strong>The body of the e-mail should not contain any unnecessary information.</strong>  Show your reader what they need to know, and speak simply. Break up your paragraphs or longer sentences with a single, blank line as this text has done in order to help the reader move quicker through the text. <br>
<br>
Finally, your ending should match the recipient’s level of formality.  “Best” and “regards” are common, as are “sincerely” and slightly more customized ones such as “see you then” or “until then" if you are planning a meeting, for example.

            <p>Reports are helpful in allowing decisions to be made with clarity and assurance.  All good reports share many common elements: concision in presenting the information, multiple ways of presenting it (infographics and charts, not just blocks of text!), and they display a keen awareness of the purpose of their data gathering and presentation.  <br>
<br>
Whether it’s an expense report, a feasibility report, or a usability study, all reports should help guide an audience towards making a decision or seeing an idea a certain way. They should be informative but not overwhelming. Therefore, <a href="#page86">balancing graphics with text</a> is of great importance. You want to be persuasive and informative.<br><br>
Many of the <a href="#page72">audience awareness</a> strategies in this app similarly apply to writing productive reports.  You want to be aware of to whom you’re writing, what stakes are present for the report and those working from its findings, and also what the data or findings mean in multiple contexts – not just the ones for which you wrote the report! <br><br>
The formats of reports vary from organization to organization, but most will contain several similarities:<br>
<br>
1.	A cover sheet with the title, your name, your affiliation, date, and purpose of the report. 
<br>
<br>
2.	A table of contents describing, well, the contents of the report! Be sure to pay attention to your page numbers.<br>
<br>
3.	An appendix of any important figures, symbols, abbreviations or any other “legend” (think ‘map’) appropriate material. 
<br>
<br>
4.	An abstract.  This is just like the abstracts you see in journal articles, a brief (~50 words) summary of the report. 
<br>
<br>
5.	The body of the text itself. You may choose to parse this into smaller sections. 
<br>
<br>
6.	Conclusions and recommendations

            <p>Social media writing is a different animal than most.  It requires a user be extremely brief (in Twitter’s case, less than 140 characters), super-concise, and often connecting with others through the use of links, hashtags, or other characters. Readers spend significantly less time reading a Facebook status, a Tweet, or a blog post than they would reading an expense report, letter, or even an e-mail.  
<br><br>
Therefore, consider your audience’s relatively short span of engagement with your writing as a chance for you to distill your message clearly and accurately. 
Try to link with others by using hashtags or other symbols appropriate to the medium (@, etc.). It is <em>social</em> media, after all! Hashtagging is kind of like a thesis statement, in that one or two words (usually without spaces) will sum up the content of your communication.  
<br><br>
Using links to other websites is also part of the social media experience, sharing other parts of the Internet outside of the immediate social network site.  Try providing a link to a relevant article or video. You can shorten the URL by using various URL shorteners such as goo.gl or bit.ly to fit character requirements.

            <p>Two key elements of a successful professional collaboration are time management and communication. Whether you’re a leader or project member, understanding how to manage your time (and the group’s!) and communicate productively with your group is important.<br>
<br>  
Some time management strategies include <strong>setting micro-deadlines</strong>, where smaller “chunks” of activity (such as setting up a chart, producing a graphic design, interviewing someone, etc.) are put on a time schedule.  Being able to determine how much time the smaller activities are going to take will help your group understand how much time the entire project will consume.
<br><br>
Communication strategies find a place between being <a href="#page74">compassionate</a> to your group members’ needs as well as being clear and concise – much like when <a href="#page87">writing a memo</a>. To better facilitate communication among your group members, make sure that you know how to best contact each of them: e-mail, mobile phone, carrier pigeon or smoke signals, whatever - make sure you’re able to communicate with them. And remember to be courteous – no one wants a midnight text about an expense report!

            <p>In a project team that does not have an explicit leader, you can help take the reigns and delegate responsibilities to various members of the team so that everyone feels that they themselves are a leader. Play to the members’ strengths or areas of expertise, that way they retain a sense of control and direction over a specific aspect of the project.  If you are unsure about your group members' strengths, simply have a small chat session where everyone shares what they feel their strengths are.  
<br><br>
Make sure that everyone is somehow accountable for their own work as well as the work of others.  You can help this process by suggesting that certain tasks be delegated to members of the group, the completion of which should have clear deliverables – a completed graphic or chart, a finished and printed interview, etc. Having a producable item goes a long way towards motivation.  
<br><br>
Again, communication is key in collaborative projects.  Everyone should know how to contact everyone else, and should keep them apprised of any new developments on the project.  Google Documents works extremely well for this: set up a new document, share it with the group members, and have everyone “check in” on the document regarding their part in the project.  This also serves as a handy reflection tool that makes participants <a href="#page78">think inwardly about their own products and processes</a>.

            <p>There’s always that one person who is just along for the ride.  In many collaborative projects, there might be an individual who does not contribute as much as the other members, and that’s okay – you can help them, and help your team by doing so. 
<br><br>
Give the individual a clear objective, goal, or task.  Also, outline a circumstance that will provide your group with the acknowledgement that this person has completed the task: a finished piece of text, an expense sheet, some type of product that you can clearly see progress or completion. 
<br><br>
Make this person feel like he or she is a valued member of your project team.  Ask them for input often.  <strong>Constant communication is the key.</strong>  And while giving large responsibilities may seem like a bad idea, you can help delegate non-critical tasks to them while retaining the more heavy lifting for those who will produce more productively.

            <p>When coordinating a group, either putting one together or coordinating efforts within a group, a good idea is to <strong>determine what skills the project will require</strong> and clearly articulate these either on page or verbally to your group members.  Then, <strong>play to the strengths of the individual members.</strong> You want to maximize efficiency of each group member’s efforts in order to maximize overall group productivity. 
<br><br>
Perhaps one element of the project requires math and organizational skills, as well as the ability to compose and maintain spreadsheets over a period of time. You would want to know who in your group (or potential group members) has these abilities, perhaps who has had prior experience doing similar things, and politely ask them to take charge of that aspect of the project. Trust their expertise that they are able to fulfill the task.  
<br><br>
Once everyone has their responsibilities delegated, try to establish some kind of timeframe to have “something” completed.  Ideally, everyone should be able to show some kind of progress after they have had time to work in their own focused area of the project.  After everyone is satisfied that they have completed their responsibilities, it is helpful to bring the entire group back together to compile the individual efforts into the final version of the project.  You don’t want to have fragmentation in your project where everyone is just ‘doing their own thing’ without making their part fit the larger scope of the project.

            <p>Imagine someone asked you to tell them about your research, but you could only use one or two word replies.  What would you say?  Your responses would be “keywords,” broad concepts that serve to target main ideas in the article. For those familiar with the social networking site Twitter, <strong>think of keywords as “hashtags.”</strong>
            <br><br>
You can search for two or more keywords describing one idea (such as “global warming”) simply by <strong>encasing them in quotation marks.</strong>  This searches for both words as one concept.  For example, if I were researching the topic of global warming, I’d likely use the following keywords in a search: “global warming,” pollution, “carbon dioxide increase”, and perhaps “temperature change.”  <br>
<br>
In most search engines (such as JSTOR), you can <strong>add additional search fields</strong> using “Boolean Operators” such as AND and NOT from a dropdown menu to link or separate ideas. If I wanted to search “global warming” but not include everything about “carbon dioxide,” I would use the operator NOT. 
<br><br>
Once you find article titles that appeal to you, now you have to sift through the articles and choose the appropriate sources.  You can start by simply reading the abstracts and see if anything fits your own research interests, your topic, or a particular methodology with which you’re working.

            <p>Organizing your research into groups is another great idea that works towards synthesis goals – those which seek to connect your sources together.  To <strong>put your sources into conversations together,</strong> you might choose to group similar research items together.  Do multiple authors talk about a specific aspect of a topic? Can you <strong>find common threads between a few sources</strong>?  Having a narrowed, topical list of what articles you've found allows you to see the broader pictures of the field of research you're exploring. 
<br><br>
As you begin to group together sources, you'll want to record their groupings somehow that describe the features of that particular set of sources (a folder name, in-document annotation like a footnote or an additional text document, for example).  See if there any kind of “themes” that occur throughout the articles. If it helps, you can dip into some <a href="#page91">social media</a> instincts and write a “hashtag” for each of the articles to try and identify patterns.

            <p>A really great way to prepare your notes is extending your efforts in keeping the <a href="#page107">“reading/research journal.”</a> After you have prepared your preliminary thoughts on the articles, grouped them together, try to reflect on the source as you briefly <a href="#page100">annotate</a> or summarize them. You could ask yourself a few questions to prepare your sources for your work: <br><br>
1.	How is this source relevant to my topic? <br><br>
2.	What is this source trying to say? <br><br>
3.	What special angle is the author taking, specifically, about my topic? <br><br>
4.	Is the author’s method one that I could use in my own research? <br><br>
5.	In what other contexts could this work be applied?
<br><br>
Once you have a smattering of ideas written down about your articles, it is time to have a conversation with them! It is also very helpful to print out your sources and write all over them. When I have several sources that are helpful for my writing, I like to set them side-by-side and <strong>“read across”</strong> them to <strong>find thematic links</strong> or points at which I could begin a relevant conversation.

            <p>Annotations are simply <a href="#page102">conversations</a> between you and your sources, and sometimes even between sources (<a href="#page49">“synthesis”</a>) where appropriate.  <strong>A good annotation will perform two functions: evaluate and analyze.</strong>  A helpful annotation should serve the writer in quickly referring to their sources in detail. Even if you write a few sentences about the source – it will pay off later. You might be able to use some of the annotation directly in your research! <br><br>
<strong>Evaluation</strong> on a source includes discussing the author’s ethos (their credibility), the source in context with the author’s other work, the source’s relevance in the field, and anything else that speaks towards giving a “review” of the source.  Also think about how YOU might use the source in your own work. 
<br><br>
<strong>Analysis</strong> on the other hand describes the content of the source itself.  This is more of a “report” or a “summary” of main ideas of the source.  What is it talking about? How is it talking about it  (the author's method)? Try to pick out the main ideas of the piece and distill them in a sentence or two for quicker annotations <br><br>
Note here that in the contexts of some annotation assignments, you will want to make your annotations longer - spend more time on either or both aspects (evaluation and analysis) to flesh out a detailed and usable annotation.

            <p>Kenneth Burke has a wonderful <a href="http://www.technorhetoric.net/2.1/features/brent/burke.htm" target="_system">“Parlor” metaphor</a> that shows how knowledge grows, building off previous knowledge.  Imagine a parlor where there are many voices (these are your sources) speaking, many people have come before you, and many people will come after you.  Just because you, or any of them leave, does not mean the conversation stops.  You can enter and exit conversations anytime, jumping between them. This is an appropriate way to consider your entrance into the conversation that your sources are having. <br><br>
As you read your sources, play along with what they’re saying – talk with them, if you have an idea about the source, a question about it, or even just agree/disagree with it, write a little something in the margin, maybe in a speech bubble to keep the metaphor alive. <br><br>
When talking with your sources, <strong>try to see where the conversation has already been, and speculate as to where it might be going.</strong> This way, you will see more of the whole scope of the rhetorical sitaution in which the piece of writing exists.

            <p>Now that you’ve <a href="#page102">started a conversation</a> between yourself and your sources (as well as between your sources themselves!), it is time to extend that conversation into a meaningful context – your writing. A neat exercise for this is to <strong>inhabit the role of the authors </strong>with whom you’re working; pretend that they are talking about YOUR subject matter – what would they say?  How would so-and-so react to your thesis? How would they work with it based on their own methodology you’ve already drawn out from their source (in your <a href="#page100">annotations</a>, right?). <br><br>
If you are absolutely stuck and have no idea how to talk with your sources, just ask them a single, simple question: <strong>“So what?”</strong> Why care about a particular idea? What, exactly, does this piece of writing actually “mean?” What does it contribute to the field? Evaluating the source is a good go-to option when the conversation with your sources might have grown stale.

            <p>Highlighting is one of the best tricks to retaining content as well as understanding the important ideas in a piece of writing. So, how do you figure out what to highlight? You can <strong>look for strong assertions</strong> about an idea, basically what the author says something is or is not.  Any kind of definitions are good things to highlight.  <br>
<br>
The <strong>thesis statement(s)</strong> are also great candidates for highlights.  These are going to tell the reader what the main thrust of the piece of writing is, what the main idea the author is going to explore, and quite often, how their work fits into the scope of work already done on the subject. 
<br><br>
An interesting exercise for highlighting involves imagining that you are going to give a class a test on the article and you need to <strong>come up with questions and answers.</strong>  Any really important ideas that you come across – highlight them, then come up with a question to ask about them.  This helps you retain the content, as well as <strong>contextualize it for your own research. </strong> Those questions might be largely helpful! 
<br><br>
I encourage drawing all over your sources and all in your books (ones that you own, of course!).  If ideas connect, draw a line between them.  If you have something to say about a particular passage, draw an arrow out into the margin and write a brief thought about it.  Liberally use circles for any key concepts, and connect these circles with lines: whatever helps you visually represent the structure of the work, or the connections between the content.

      <p>So you don’t spend forever and a day taking notes on each article you read, keep your notes very short.  Make use of <a href="#page96">“keywords,”</a> kind of like you’re searching in a database to organize your thoughts.  You could even use hashtags if that helps or bold/underline them. The idea here is to spend as few words to remind yourself about a larger idea you have about the part of the writing. <br><br>
You want to <strong>trigger the internal conversation that you have about the particular section or idea</strong>, and use as few words (or images!) to do that.  For example, if I think a section reminds me of a particular author, I might write his or her name in the margin and move on.  If something resonates with a particular theory, I might write its name or its formula off to the side. In any sense, you want to keep your notes as short as possible when writing in the text.  You have plenty of space for longer notes in your <a href="#page107">research journal</a>, or in your <a href="#page100">annotations</a> page. <br><br>
Remember, the less time you spend on your notes, the more time your mind can engage with the material itself. That's not a license to slack on note-taking, but rather an encouragement to be brief and targeted.

            <p>One of the best summary techniques that I have found is to <strong>write the main idea of the paragraph in the margin beside the paragraph itself</strong>.  You should be able to condense each paragraph down into less than five words.  This way, when you’re reading or rereading the source, you are able to jump around quickly between paragraphs using this indexing system.
<br><br>
If you are having difficulty figuring out what the main idea of the paragraph is, you could also <strong>talk about the paragraph’s function</strong> – how it’s working in the piece.  Perhaps you have found the author’s methodology section, how they’re doing what they’re doing.  You could simply write "method" in the margin, and leave it at that.  Or, you can briefly extend that into what kind of method it is – "method: survey" or "method: comparison."

            <p>Keeping a record of everything you read is a wonderful way to organize your work and save yourself a great deal of time in your writing process.  A reading or research journal is kind of like keeping a reflective writing journal, except you’re discussing what you have read and what you will read.  You can break it up into a few different types of discussion: <br><br>
1.	<strong>Pre-reading</strong> - those articles which you will read, what you expect to find in them and why you believe they might be helpful. This section could also be about the kinds of articles you hope to find, the keywords you used to find them, and the source destinations you chose to use (journal databases, books at a library, interviews from a broadcast, etc.). Having this record allows you to revisit the initial experience of searching.<br><br>
2.	<strong>Post-reading</strong> - those articles which you have already read, what you found important within them, how they might be helpful. <br><br>
3.	<strong>Current reading </strong>– those articles that you are currently reading but may not be complete.  This could also include articles whose citations you gathered and perhaps even annotated from the abstract but not yet made it into the body of the text.<br><br>

The point of keeping such a journal is to reflect upon the work that you’ve read or will read, to prime your mind to engage with the work so that you do not go into the article “blindly.”

      <p>The old mantra of “reading the first and last sentence” is not really that far off from what scanning a page quickly for information is.  More accurately, that mantra is really saying <strong>“read the important information”</strong> (not to suggest that all the information isn’t important, right?).  Sometimes in academia, readers are simply used to having the most important information in a paragraph coming near the beginning and end, with all that stuff sandwiched in between to link the two ends together. So being able to pick out what’s the “important” information can sometimes be a delicate matter, and sometimes it can be straight-forward.
<br><br>
First, you want to try to <a href="#page109">identify key concepts</a> within the paragraph.  Are there any definitions or critical terms being used? There should be a sentence or a few that really stand out - they use <strong>directive language</strong> about the subject (first, next, therefore, however, etc.).  Are there any exclaimations or clear, declaritive language towards the subject? These are good places to find key concepts. 
<br>
<br>
Hunting for key concepts will help you understand what the <a href="#page110">big picture</a> in the text is before trying to see the <a href="#page111">smaller pictures</a>.

      <p>Definitely, definitely read the first sentence of the paragraph, before working your way “through” the paragraph “towards” the end.  Internalize the first sentence and what it’s trying to say. Maybe have a little internal dialogue about it. As you’re in the middle of the paragraph, <strong>look for directive words that “move” the text</strong>: “unless”, “for example”, “but”, “also”, “since”, and so on.  These are usually an indicator that the text the follows is pretty important to understanding the concepts built earlier in the paragraph. 
<br><br>
See if you can <strong>recognize a pattern </strong>of the way the text is presenting its information. There is surely a logical ordering to it.  Sometimes an <strong>author will forecast</strong> what ideas are going to be central, like the example above.  Other times there will be a pattern of explanation such as “topic sentence” -> “supporting sentence” that will repeat throughout the text.  Being able to sense and <strong>recognize patterns</strong> is something that is developed over the course of reading much and reading often, but it comes, like anything, quicker with ample practice.  You will want to read liberally to develop this important skill. 
<br><br>
Also definitely, definitely read the last sentence of the paragraph.  At this point, can you see how the last sentence “ties” the paragraph together? Does it relate to anything you just read in the body of the paragraph, or does it work with/against the first sentence? Do you see how it <strong>transitions</strong> into the next paragraph, the next <strong>group of related ideas?</strong>  Being able to <em>form relationships</em> between the concluding sentence and the content of the paragraph is central to retaining the information, and being able to quickly move through a text.

            <p>Once you’ve found <a href="#page109">key concepts</a> in each paragraph, keep a running checklist in your mind about the main ideas that these concepts are discussing.  If it helps, write them down.  <br>
<br>
“Looking at the big picture” means <strong>identifying themes</strong>, or larger bodies of thought present throughout the work. Perhaps there is something that the author repeats throughout the document, or a key concept that is being challenged throughout the work.  Does the main idea or thesis statement somehow manifest itself throughout the work in different ways? Are there any <a href="#page60">particular frameworks</a> the author is employing for their discussion? These are things on which you could focus when looking at the broader sense of the work. <br><br>
If you had to distill the entire text into one Tweet (140 characters or less), what would it be?  What handful of hashtags would you apply to the text?  Those two quick exercises will help you to condense the bigger ideas of the work.
